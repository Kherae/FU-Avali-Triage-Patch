  "description" : "What the patch does:\n\nAdds missing categories to blocks, for better Item Network support. Made adjustments to some descriptions, and to some names which were shared.\nReplaces references in produce-related recipes with their FU counterparts (including terramart sales).\nCleanly patches objects that the coloriser supports to ensure they all retain color on breaking the object.\nPatches a few beds to have the 'bed' colony tag.\nReplaces entries in avali produce harvest pools, and avali merchant pools, with their FU equivalents. Does so for avali plus, as well.\nMakes avali foods more available to produce.\nNow supports Avali Food and Drink mod and Avalionian Culture Shock.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/Kherae/FU-Avali-Triage-Patch",
